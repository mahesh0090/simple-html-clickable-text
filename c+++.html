    <p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs developed C++ in 1979 as an extension of the C language; originally, it was called "C with Classes." It was designed to add object-oriented features to C while maintaining its performance and low-level memory manipulation capabilities. The first version of C++ was released to the public in 1983.
